            <span className="font-bold">Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!</span> I’m Farhana, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building intuitive and scalable web applications.  
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My journey into web development started with an initial curiosity about how websites work, leading me to dive deep into both front-end and back-end technologies. Through my training at <span className="font-semibold">BloomTech</span>, I gained hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express, and Tailwind CSS—tools that allow me to create dynamic, user-centered applications.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Before I became a developer, I worked in <span className="italic">customer service</span> and as a  <span className="italic">trainer</span> at <span className="font-semibold">Amazon,</span> where I developed strong skills in communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. These experiences taught me how to listen to user needs and explain technical concepts in accessible ways—skills that are invaluable when creating effective solutions.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Outside of coding, I’m passionate about personal development, fitness, and traveling. Whether it’s through pilates or immersing myself in different cultures, I believe in growing both professionally and personally.  
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I’m driven by the challenge of solving complex problems with clean, efficient solutions, whether it's designing a user interface or building robust back-end systems. I strive to create applications that are not only functional but also delight users.
